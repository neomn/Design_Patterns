The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. Let me explain its key aspects, problems it solves, pros and cons, and how it compares to other creational patterns.
What it solves:

1- Simplifies creation of complex objects with many parameters
2- Allows step-by-step construction of objects
3- Enables creation of different representations of an object using the same construction process

Pros:
1- Encapsulates object creation code, improving maintainability
2- Allows fine control over the construction process
3- Supports creation of different representations easily
4- Improves readability when dealing with objects that have many parameters

Cons:
 1- Can lead to increased code complexity due to additional classes
 2- May be overkill for simple objects
 3- Requires creating a separate ConcreteBuilder for each type of product

Comparison with other creational patterns:

Factory Method:
Builder focuses on step-by-step object creation, while Factory Method creates objects in a single step
Builder is more flexible for complex objects, Factory Method is simpler for basic object creation


Abstract Factory:
Abstract Factory creates families of related objects, while Builder focuses on creating a single complex object
Abstract Factory is more suitable when dealing with multiple product types


Prototype:
Prototype clones existing objects, while Builder constructs new objects from scratch
Prototype is useful when object creation is expensive, Builder when object creation is complex


Singleton:
Singleton ensures a class has only one instance, while Builder focuses on flexible object creation
They solve different problems and are often used for different purposes
